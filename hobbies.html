    I enjoy listening to audiobooks on philosophy and podcasts about diets and human physiology. 
    Exploring these topics has become a favorite pastime, and I'm always eager to learn more.

    When I'm not diving into reading or podcasts, I enjoy spending time with myself, reflecting on life, and listening to some 
    upbeat house music. While I'm not the best cook around, I do love to cook and try out new recipes whenever I get the chance.
    I love admiring the beauty of nature, and I love taking in the stunning views of landscapes.

    I studied economics in university for six semesters, but
    I realized that my true passion lies in programming. 
    I'm currently focused on Advancing in my career as a Web developer, 
    and I'm giving it my all to achieve this goal. With a strong focus     
    on both front-end and back-end development, I'm dedicated to becoming a 
    skilled and efficient developer, committed to delivering exceptional 
    work on every project I take on.
