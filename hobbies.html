<h1>Hobbies</h1>

<p>
  I enjoy listening to audiobooks on philosophy and podcasts, my favorites are
  Dr. Andrew Huberman, Lex Fridman & Dr. Jordan B. Peterson. Exploring these
  topics has become a favorite pastime, always trying to learn more.

<p>
  When I'm not into reading or podcasts, I like spending time with myself,
  reflecting on life, and listening to some upbeat house music, Teddy Swims, MGK
  or Post Malone. While I'm not the best cook around, I do love to cook and try
  out new recipes whenever I get the chance. I love admiring the beauty of
  nature, and I love taking in the stunning views of landscapes.

<h2>Bio Intro</h2>
<p>
  I studied economics in university for six semesters, but I realized that my
  true passion lies in technology programming. I'm currently focused on
  Advancing in my career as a Web developer, and I'm giving it my all to achieve
  this goal. With a strong emphasis on both frontend and backend development,
  though I lean more towards backend work. I'm dedicated to becoming a skilled
  developer, delivering exceptional work on every project I take on.
