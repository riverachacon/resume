    I have a deep interest in exploring the complexities of human psychology,  human behavior, and relationships.
    Reading about these topics has become one of my favorite pastimes, 
    and I'm always eager to learn more.

    When I'm not diving into reading or podcasts, I enjoy spending time with myself, reflecting on life, and listening to some 
    upbeat house music. While I'm not the best cook around, I do love to cook and try out new recipes whenever I get the chance.
    One of my passions is admiring the beauty of nature, and I love taking in the stunning views of landscapes.

    I studied economics in university for six semesters, but
    I realized that my true passion lies in software engineering. 
    I'm currently focused on pursuing a career as a software engineer, 
    and I'm giving it my all to achieve this goal. With a strong focus     
    on both front-end and back-end development, I'm dedicated to becoming a 
    skilled and efficient developer, and I'm committed to delivering exceptional 
    work on every project I take on.
